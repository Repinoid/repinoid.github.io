1. Zone of visibility from a certain point and height. <br>
2. Panorama of the horizon <br>
3. Graph of heights in the direction <br>
4. A map of heights indicating the lowest and highest points <br>
5. Shadow Map <br>
6. Graph of heights along the polyline <br><hr>
After opening the page, the map is positioned in your current location, if not - somewhere in the Alps. <br>
In the case of URL with pre-set coordinates - according to them. <br>
After this, the coordinates can be changed either manually, dragging the map by mouse left button pressed,
or specify the latitude / longitude coordinates or address by clicking the tab <img src='IMG/SearchLoc.gif'> at the left of the screen. <br>

Click <img src='IMG/Download.gif'><br>

The torn layer appears, representing a surface visible from the point of the Eye. <br>
The painted areas are zones of visibility. What is not painted over is hidden from view: behind an obstacle, in a low place or beyond the horizon.<br><br>
<img src='IMG/11.jpg'><br>

You can change Point of View position, dragging the Eye.
To change the height of the observer use slider to the left of <img src='IMG/rost.gif'><hr><br>

Indicators <br>
<img src = 'IMG/topcontrols.jpg'>
<br>

<span style = "color: Red"> H - altitude </span> in the point under the cursor (indicated in the measured areas) <br>
D is the distance from the observer's point <img src = 'IMG/eye.gif'> to the position of the cursor <br>
A - the azimuth from the observer's point to the position of the cursor<br>
LAT - Latitude<br>
LNG - longitude<br>

A rectangle appears in the upper right corner.
Drag it with the mouse, green and red text markers indicate the minimum and maximum heights <br>
for the area bounded by a rectangle.

 Setting options <br>
Angular accuracy  - <img src='IMG/sector.gif'> width of the calculation sector. <br>
Iteration steps quantity  <img src='IMG/step.gif'> - With larger values - more accurate the result <br>
But - at a low computer processor speed, the picture will slow down. <br>
Background transparency and color menu <img src='IMG/spot.gif'> - for the zone of visibility. <br>
Change if the color of the card itself merges with the overlay <br>
<hr>
<img src='IMG/piks.gif'>
 Panorama of the horizon <br>
To obtain a more detailed picture, it is necessary to reduce the Angular accuracy (see above) <br>
or get the maximum resolution for a given position and height by clicking the Max button in the lower right corner of the screen. <br>
There you can change the view sector <br>
To the left of the panorama, the maximum and minimum angles of visibility are indicated. <br>
With a flat terrain, the picture will be more different from the real one. <br>
<hr>
<img src='IMG/eleSlice.gif'>
 Height chart. The green vertical bar indicates the horizon point <br>

<hr>
<img src='IMG/Topo.gif'>
Topography. More pale / greener the layer - smaller the height. Redder - more. <br>
The points with the maximum and minimum measured heights are indicated. <br>
To delete a layer, press <img src='IMG/Topo30.gif'>  again 
<hr>
<img src='IMG/sunny.gif'> Shadow <br>
The slider on the bottom left is the time. From dawn to dusk. <br>
To the right is the task of the date. <br>
World time is determined by geographic coordinates, so it can differ from the real one. <br>
The shift from Greenwich is indicated after GMT 
<hr>
<img src='IMG/poly.gif'> Graph of heights along the polyline. <br>
Set the beginning of the line by clicking the left mouse button. Add points. <br>
Complete the line - right mouse button. <br>
The line can be edited by stretching over the top. 
<hr>
Example. Pink - zone of visibility. Gray is a shadow. Red line - the direction from the sun <br><br>
